        <h1>Aprende Sass</h1>

        <div class="container">

                <p>Before you can use Sass, you need to set it up on
                        your project.
                        If you want to just browse here, go ahead, but
                        we recommend you
                        go install Sass first. Go here if you want to
                        learn how to get
                        everything set up.</p>

                <button class="accordion">PREPROCESSING</button>
                <div class="panel">
                        <p>CSS on its own can be fun, but
                                stylesheets are getting larger, more
                                complex, and harder to maintain. This is
                                where a preprocessor can help. Sass has
                                features that don't exist in CSS yet
                                like nesting, mixins, inheritance, and
                                other nifty goodies that help you write
                                robust, maintainable CSS.</p>

                        <p>Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will
                                take your preprocessed Sass file and
                                save it as a normal CSS file that you
                                can use in your website.</p>

                        <p>The most direct way to make this happen is in
                                your terminal. Once Sass is installed,
                                you can compile your Sass to CSS using
                                the sass command. You'll need to tell
                                Sass which file to build from, and where
                                to output CSS to. For example, running
                                sass input.scss output.css from your
                                terminal would take a single Sass file,
                                input.scss, and compile that file to
                                output.css.</p>

                        <p>You can also watch individual files or
                                directories with the --watch flag. The
                                watch flag tells Sass to watch your
                                source files for changes, and re-compile
                                CSS each time you save your Sass. If you
                                wanted to watch (instead of manually
                                build) your input.scss file, you'd just
                                add the watch flag to your command, like
                                so:</p>

                        <blockquote>sass --watch input.scss output.css</blockquote>
                        <p>You can watch and output to directories by
                                using folder paths as your input and
                                output, and separating them with a
                                colon. In this example:</p>

                        <blockquote>sass --watch
                                app/sass:public/stylesheets</blockquote>
                        <p>Sass would watch all files in the "app/sass"
                                folder for changes, and compile CSS to
                                the "public/stylesheets" folder.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">VARIABLES</button>
                <div class="panel">
                        <p>Think of variables as a way to
                                store information that you want to reuse
                                throughout your stylesheet. You can
                                store things like colors, font stacks,
                                or any CSS value you think you'll want
                                to reuse. Sass uses the $ symbol to make
                                something a variable. Here's an example:</p>
                        <blockquote>$font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif
                                $primary-color: #333

                                body
                                font: 100% $font-stack
                                color: $primary-color</blockquote>

                        <p>When the Sass is processed, it takes the
                                variables we define for the $font-stack
                                and $primary-color and outputs normal
                                CSS with our variable values placed in
                                the CSS. This can be extremely powerful
                                when working with brand colors and
                                keeping them consistent throughout the
                                site.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">NESTING</button>
                <div class="panel">
                        <p>When writing HTML you've probably noticed that it has a clear nested and visual hierarchy.
                                CSS, on the other hand, doesn't.</p>
                        <p>Sass will let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of
                                your HTML. Be aware that overly nested rules will result in over-qualified CSS that
                                could prove hard to maintain and is generally considered bad practice.</p>
                        <p>With that in mind, here's an example of some typical styles for a site's navigation:</p>
                        <blockquote>nav {
                                ul {
                                margin: 0;
                                padding: 0;
                                list-style: none;
                                }

                                li { display: inline-block; }

                                a {
                                display: block;
                                padding: 6px 12px;
                                text-decoration: none;
                                }
                                }</blockquote>

                        <p>You'll notice that the ul, li, and a selectors are nested inside the nav selector. This is a
                                great way to organize your CSS and make it more readable.</p>

                </div>
                <button class="accordion">PARTIALS</button>
                <div class="panel">
                        <p>You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in
                                other Sass files. This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier
                                to maintain. A partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it
                                something like _partial.scss. The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a
                                partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used
                                with the @use rule.</p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">MODULES</button>
                <div class="panel">
                        <p> You don't have to write all your Sass in a single file. You can split it up however you want
                                with the @use rule. This rule loads another Sass file as a module, which means you can
                                refer to its variables, mixins, and functions in your Sass file with a namespace based
                                on the filename. Using a file will also include the CSS it generates in your compiled
                                output!</p>
                        <blockquote>// _base.scss
                                $font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;
                                $primary-color: #333;

                                body {
                                font: 100% $font-stack;
                                color: $primary-color;
                                }</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>// styles.scss
                                @use 'base';

                                .inverse {
                                background-color: base.$primary-color;
                                color: white;
                                }</blockquote>
                        <p>Notice we're using @use 'base'; in the styles.scss file. When you use a file you don't need
                                to include the file extension. Sass is smart and will figure it out for you.</p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">MIXINS</button>
                <div class="panel">
                        <p>Some things in CSS are a bit tedious to write, especially with CSS3 and the many vendor
                                prefixes that exist. A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to
                                reuse throughout your site. It helps keep your Sass very DRY. You can even pass in
                                values to make your mixin more flexible. Here's an example for theme.</p>
                        <blockquote>@mixin theme($theme: DarkGray) {
                                background: $theme;
                                box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba($theme, .25);
                                color: #fff;
                                }

                                .info {
                                @include theme;
                                }
                                .alert {
                                @include theme($theme: DarkRed);
                                }
                                .success {
                                @include theme($theme: DarkGreen);
                                }</blockquote>
                        <p>To create a mixin you use the @mixin directive and give it a name. We've named our mixin
                                theme. We're also using the variable $theme inside the parentheses so we can pass in a
                                theme of whatever we want. After you create your mixin, you can then use it as a CSS
                                declaration starting with @include followed by the name of the mixin.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                        <p>Using @extend lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. In our
                                example we're going to create a simple series of messaging for errors, warnings and
                                successes using another feature which goes hand in hand with extend, placeholder
                                classes. A placeholder class is a special type of class that only prints when it is
                                extended, and can help keep your compiled CSS neat and clean.</p>

                        <p>What the above code does is tells .message, .success, .error, and .warning to behave just
                                like %message-shared. That means anywhere that %message-shared shows up, .message,
                                .success, .error, & .warning will too. The magic happens in the generated CSS, where
                                each of these classes will get the same CSS properties as %message-shared. This helps
                                you avoid having to write multiple class names on HTML elements.
                        </p>

                        <p>You can extend most simple CSS selectors in addition to placeholder classes in Sass, but
                                using placeholders is the easiest way to make sure you aren't extending a class that's
                                nested elsewhere in your styles, which can result in unintended selectors in your CSS.
                        </p>

                        <p>Note that the CSS in %equal-heights isn't generated, because %equal-heights is never
                                extended.</p>

                        <p>Doing math in your CSS is very helpful. Sass has a handful of standard math operators like +,
                                -, *, math.div(), and %. In our example we're going to do some simple math to calculate
                                widths for an article and aside.</p>

                                }

                                article[role="main"] {
                                width: math.div(600px, 960px) * 100%;
                                }

                                aside[role="complementary"] {
                                width: math.div(300px, 960px) * 100%;
                                margin-left: auto;

                        <p>We've created a very simple fluid grid, based on 960px. Operations in Sass let us do
                                something like take pixel values and convert them to percentages without much hassle.
